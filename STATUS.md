# Status

Append entries: time, who (Claude or Codex), what finished, what is next, notes for the other side.

## Scaffold
- Vite + React app with suncalc and vitest. Run npm install after cloning.
- AGENTS.md is the brief. CLAUDE.md imports it.
- Next: Claude on `engine` branch, Codex on `ui` branch.

## 2026-09-26 01:39 UTC — Claude — effectiveDusk
- Done: `src/engine/sky.js` with `effectiveDusk(date, lat, lon)` + 16 unit tests in `src/engine/__tests__/sky.test.js` (all passing).
- Formula: cloudCover = average hourly cloud_cover over the 2h before sunset; shift = round(cloudCover / 100 * 30) min; effectiveDusk = sunset - shift.
- Contract (new `src/engine/index.js`): `effectiveDusk(date, lat, lon)` is **async** and resolves to
  `{ sunset: Date, cloudCover: number|null, shiftMinutes: number, effectiveDusk: Date, source: 'open-meteo'|'offline' }`.
  If Open-Meteo is unreachable it falls back to SunCalc sunset with no cloud shift and `source: 'offline'` (UI may want to show "offline, no cloud data").
  Also exported: `computeEffectiveDusk(sunset, hourly)`, `cloudShiftMinutes(percent)`.
- Note: suncalc 2.x is ESM with named exports: `import { getTimes } from 'suncalc'` (no default export).
- Next: `moonriseStart(effectiveDusk, logs)`.

## 2026-09-26 01:44 UTC — Claude — moonriseStart
- Done: `src/engine/schedule.js` with `moonriseStart(effectiveDusk, logs)` + tests (26 passing total).
- Returns `{ start: Date, minutesBeforeDusk, basis: 'default'|'learned', episodesUsed }`. Default 45 min before dusk; with 3+ logged evenings and at least one timed episode, uses median(onset - dusk) - 20 min, clamped to 15..90 min before dusk.
- **Log shape (UI please save logs like this):**
  `{ date: 'YYYY-MM-DD', outcome: 'calm'|'restless'|'episode', episodeStart: ISO|null, effectiveDusk: ISO, cloudCover: number|null, songIds: string[] }`.
  Store that evening's `effectiveDusk` and `cloudCover` from `effectiveDusk()`, and the ids of songs played in Moonrise mode.
- Contract: added `moonriseStart`, `onsetMinutes` to `src/engine/index.js`.
- Next: songs (songs.json, eraYears, songScore, playlist).

## 2026-09-26 01:44 UTC — Claude — songs
- Done: `src/data/songs.json` (47 real songs, 1941 to 1978, each `{ id, title, artist, year }`), `src/engine/songs.js`, `src/engine/random.js` (seeded random), tests (37 passing total).
- `eraYears(birthYear)` -> `{ from, to }` (age 10 to 30). `eraSongs(birthYear)` filters songs.json. Born 1942 -> 1952..1972.
- `songScore(songId, logs)`: +1 calm, -1 episode, 0 restless. `playlist(birthYear, logs)` -> era songs with `score`, best first, ties shuffled.
- `spotifySearchUrl(song)`, `youtubeSearchUrl(song)`, `findSong(id)` for the play link and report.
- Contract: added the above to `src/engine/index.js`.
- Next: weeklyReport.

## 2026-09-26 01:45 UTC — Claude — weeklyReport
- Done: `src/engine/report.js` + tests (45 passing total).
- `weeklyReport(logs, { endDate })` -> `{ from, to, evenings, counts: {calm, restless, episode}, onset: {minutes, medianMinutes, text}, cloudy: {evenings, episodes}, clear: {evenings, episodes}, topSongs: [{...song, score, plays}], nights: [{date, outcome, onsetText, cloudCover}], doctorNote, supportNote }`.
- 7 days ending on endDate (default today). Cloudy = cloudCover >= 50%. Please render `doctorNote` and `supportNote` on the printed page.
- `formatOnset(minutes)` -> "25 min before dusk" / "at dusk" / "10 min after dusk".
- Next: moon + sky darkness for Moonrise mode, memory prompts, demo week.

## 2026-09-26 01:46 UTC — Claude — moon phase + live sky
- Done: `src/engine/moon.js` + tests (52 passing total).
- `moonPhase(date)` -> `{ phase: 0..1, illumination: 0..1, name }` (e.g. "Waxing Gibbous") for the Today card.
- `skyState(date, lat, lon)` -> `{ sunAltitude, darkness, warmth, brightness, gradient: { top, bottom } }`. For Moonrise mode: call every minute or so, use `gradient` as the background, `warmth` (0..1) for a warm overlay, `brightness` (0.5..1) for screen brightness. darkness is 0 at sun altitude >= 6 deg and 1 at <= -12 deg.
- `skyGradient(darkness)` also exported if you want to preview/animate.
- Next: memory prompts, demo week.

## 2026-09-26 01:47 UTC — Claude — memory prompts
- Done: `src/engine/prompts.js` + tests (60 passing total).
- `memoryPrompts(profile, { song })` -> string[]. profile = `{ name, birthYear, anchors: { hometown, spouse, job } }` (please save the Setup profile in this shape; job should be a role like "nurse"). Personal anchor prompts first, then era prompts (moon landing only if born before ~1962), then general ones. Passing the current `song` adds "Do you remember ... ?" first.
- `promptAt(prompts, elapsedMs)` -> the prompt to show, rotating every 3 minutes.
- Next: demo week generator.

## 2026-09-26 01:50 UTC — Claude — demo week
- Done: `src/engine/demo.js` + tests (66 passing total).
- `generateDemoWeek({ birthYear, lat, lon, endDate?, seed? })` -> 7 logs (oldest first, ending on endDate, default today), every one has `demo: true`. Seeded (default seed 1969) so the demo is repeatable. For "Load demo week": append these to stored logs and label them as demo data; filter `!log.demo` to clear them.
- Realistic shape: cloudy evenings get more episodes, onset ~35 min before dusk, two "soothing" era songs tend to play on calm nights. With London + born 1942, the start moves from 45 to 60 min before dusk and "Sweet Caroline" tops the report.
- Contract change: `weeklyReport(logs)` now defaults `endDate` to the latest logged evening (was today), so a demo week or a report printed the next morning shows the full week.
- Next: localStorage helpers.

## 2026-09-26 01:50 UTC — Claude — storage + engine complete
- Done: `src/engine/storage.js` + tests, plus a contract test (`index.test.js`) that pins the exported list. 73 tests passing, `vite build` clean.
- `loadState()` -> `{ profile, logs }` (never throws; empty state on missing/corrupt/blocked storage). `saveState(state)` -> true/false. `addLog(state, log)` (one log per date, replaces), `addDemoLogs(state, logs)`, `clearDemoLogs(state)`, `emptyState()`. All return new state objects; nothing mutates.
- Profile shape: `{ name, birthYear, lat, lon, city, anchors: { hometown, spouse, job } }`.
- **Engine is feature-complete per AGENTS.md.** Full contract is in `src/engine/index.js`. Typical Today screen flow for Codex:
  `const state = loadState()` -> `const sky = await effectiveDusk(new Date(), lat, lon)` -> `moonriseStart(sky.effectiveDusk, state.logs)` -> `moonPhase(new Date())`.
  Moonrise mode: `skyState(now, lat, lon)` each minute, `playlist(birthYear, logs)`, `memoryPrompts(profile, { song })` + `promptAt(prompts, elapsedMs)`.
  Log: `saveState(addLog(state, { date, outcome, episodeStart, effectiveDusk: sky.effectiveDusk.toISOString(), cloudCover: sky.cloudCover, songIds }))`.
- Not verified live: Open-Meteo is blocked from Claude's sandbox, so the fetch path is covered by mocked tests only. Please sanity-check it in a browser.
- Next: merge `engine` into main when you're happy; then engine side is free to help with UI wiring.

## 2026-09-26 01:52 UTC — Claude — engine merged to main
- `engine` merged into `main` (merge commit, no conflicts; includes the new package-lock.json from main). 73 tests pass on main.
- Codex: pull main to get `src/engine/index.js`. See the entries above for the contract and data shapes.

## 2026-09-26 01:58 UTC — Claude — screens wired (branch `claude-ui`, NOT merged)
- At the user's request, built all five screens on branch `claude-ui` (not `ui`, which stays free for Codex): Setup (geolocation + Open-Meteo city lookup, era songs preview), Today (sky card, countdown, 10-min heads-up alert + browser notification, moon phase), Moonrise mode (full screen, live sky gradient, stars, rising moon, warm lamp glow, song + Spotify/YouTube links, rotating read-aloud prompts, wake lock), Log (three giant buttons, optional episode time), Report (printable), Settings (load/remove demo week, edit profile, delete all). PWA manifest + icon.
- Files: `src/App.jsx`, `src/screens/*`, `src/components/*`, `src/styles/app.css`, `public/`, `index.html`.
- Verified in headless Chromium (London, 1942, demo week): start moves 6:04 -> 5:49 PM after demo load, alert fires, report prints, episode log stores songs played, state survives reload. No page errors (only blocked Open-Meteo requests in Claude's sandbox).
- Small engine change: `loadState` now keeps extra keys (the UI stores `tonight: { date, songIds }`). 74 tests pass.
- Ownership: the proposed bridge gives UI to Codex. Waiting on the user to decide whether Codex builds on `claude-ui` or starts fresh.

## 2026-09-26 02:06 UTC — Claude — handover: Codex owns `claude-ui`
- User decision: Codex takes over branch `claude-ui` (all screens). Claude will not push to it again.
- Claude stays on `engine` (engine + integrations). Any engine interface change will be raised in the coordination issue before it is made.
## 2026-09-26 02:14 UTC — Claude — weather timeout (engine branch)
- Fix: `effectiveDusk` now gives up on Open-Meteo after 8 s (request or body) and returns the offline SunCalc sunset, so bad wifi can't leave Today stuck on "Checking the sky…". The request is aborted, timer cleaned up. 3 new tests (76 total).
- Interface: backward compatible. Optional `{ timeoutMs }` option added; UI callers need no change.

## 2026-09-26 02:15 UTC — Claude — weather cache + song fact-check (engine branch)
- `effectiveDusk`: if a refresh fails, reuses this session's last good weather for the same day and place (`source: 'open-meteo', cached: true`) instead of jumping back to plain sunset mid-evening. Additive field only. 78 tests pass.
- songs.json fact-checked by web search: 44/47 confirmed. Fixed Rock Around the Clock 1955 -> 1954 (released May 1954, charted 1955) and Paper Doll 1943 -> 1942 (released 1942, charted 1943). Their ids changed to `rock-around-the-clock-1954` and `paper-doll-1942`; no code references song ids, and old demo logs just stop matching those two songs.
- Kept "As Time Goes By" as Dooley Wilson 1942 (the Casablanca performance people remember; his own record came later). Search links still find it.
- Pending Codex OK: `eveningDate` / `episodeStartFromTime` for after-midnight logging (built locally, not pushed).

## 2026-09-26 02:17 UTC — Claude — after-midnight logging helpers (approved by Codex in issue #1)
- New in `src/engine/evening.js`, exported from `index.js` (existing exports unchanged):
  - `eveningDate(now = new Date()) -> Date | null`: new Date at device-local noon of the evening `now` belongs to; before 04:00 = previous calendar day. Calendar arithmetic (DST/month/year safe), input not mutated. null for an invalid date.
  - `episodeStartFromTime(evening, 'HH:MM') -> string | null`: ISO timestamp; 00:00-03:59 = the next calendar day, otherwise the evening's own day. **null** for empty/malformed/out-of-range time, invalid evening, or a local time skipped by a DST jump.
  - `localDateString(date) -> 'YYYY-MM-DD'` now exported.
- Use `eveningDate` only for evening grouping (log date, `effectiveDusk(eveningDate(), ...)`, `tonight.date`); countdowns/animation stay on `now`.
- Tests: 23:59/00:00/03:59/04:00, month + year rollover, Chicago DST both ways (test file runs with TZ=America/Chicago), null cases, no mutation, and the 00:30-log / 23:30-onset scenario keeping the previous evening's date and dusk. 93 tests pass; also pass under TZ=Asia/Kolkata and Pacific/Auckland.

## 2026-09-26 02:17 UTC — Claude — song ids restored (per Codex review)
- Correction to the song fact-check entry above: ids are **not** renamed. `rock-around-the-clock-1955` (year 1954) and `paper-doll-1943` (year 1942) keep their shipped ids so saved logs keep their scores and report entries. Song ids are opaque and stable; only `year` changes. Documented in songs.js and pinned by tests. 95 tests pass.

## 2026-09-26 02:28 UTC — Claude — findCity (approved by Codex in issue #1)
- New export `findCity(name, { fetchFn?, timeoutMs? }) -> Promise<{ lat, lon, city } | null>` (Open-Meteo geocoding).
  - Resolves **null** only for a blank name or a successful response with no matches.
  - **Rejects** on HTTP error, network failure, 8 s timeout (request aborted), or a malformed response/result (non-finite coordinates, missing place name).
  - UI (Codex): Setup must handle null ("couldn't find that city") separately from a rejection ("couldn't check right now"); the current local findCity throws on no-match, so it's not a drop-in swap.
- Internal: new `net.js` `fetchJson` timeout helper now shared by effectiveDusk and findCity (effectiveDusk behaviour unchanged).
- Deferred per Codex: duskForecast (not built into the engine).
- 106 tests pass.

## 2026-09-26 02:42 UTC — Codex — midnight and Setup integration
- Integrated main into the UI review branch. App/Today/Log group evenings before 04:00 consistently; sky responses retain the captured date/location, and saves refuse stale sky or future/invalid onset times. Same-evening song IDs survive late logs. Demo weeks end before the current evening.
- Setup uses engine findCity, distinguishing no match from service errors; concurrent lookups are disabled. Added an accessible city label and explicit outcome button names. Storage failures are surfaced to the caregiver.
- Nine new focused UI/helper tests pass, including the 00:30/23:30 flow and 04:00 refresh. Full suite/build and browser/demo pass follow PWA integration.
## 2026-09-26 02:34 UTC — Claude — README (task L2 of the split in issue #1)
- Added README.md for judges: what it is, screens, the formulas, demo data, privacy (all on-device), how to run, layout, disclaimer.
- Task split with Codex is in issue #1 (C1-C5 Codex: after-midnight UI, Setup findCity, offline integration, Higgsfield visuals, full demo run; L1-L5 Claude: DEMO.md, README, Pages deploy prep, song expansion, brief-compliance review).

## 2026-09-26 02:39 UTC — Claude — song seed expansion (task L4)
- songs.json: 47 -> 70 songs (1940s: 20, 1950s: 25, 1960s: 12, 1970s: 13). Mostly 1940s-50s so older birth years get a real playlist (born 1925: 31 songs, born 1920: 20).
- All 23 new entries web-checked for artist + first-release year (Magic Moments corrected to 1957). Existing 47 ids/entries unchanged (verified); file now sorted by year.
- Left out on purpose as poor fits for a calming evening: White Cliffs of Dover (wartime fear/grief), Goodnight Irene (drowning lyric), Sixteen Tons, Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah (Song of the South), Tennessee Waltz (heartbreak), Hound Dog (too loud).
- Codex notes (issue #1): Ketan approved C1-C3 + demo/a11y pass; C4 media deferred. PWA patch v2 on `claude-pwa` (4c3ae9b) awaiting Codex review.

## 2026-09-26 02:40 UTC — Claude — DEMO.md runbook (task L1)
- DEMO.md: night-before checklist, the 3-minute script mapped to real taps, what to say when the sky is clear or weather is down, say/don't-say (no treatment claims), and sources.
- Opening stat: Alzheimer's Association 2026 Facts and Figures (12M+ unpaid caregivers, 19.6B hours in 2025). Seen via search snippets only (primary pages blocked in the sandbox): a human must click through before presenting.
- Honest limitation: the app tracks the real sky, so a morning demo shows daytime and the 10-min alert can't fire live. Recommendation: record a real evening run tonight as the dusk/alert footage. No staged or faked sky.

## 2026-09-26 02:44 UTC — Claude — CI + more memory prompts
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: npm ci, npm test, npm run build on every push and PR (all branches). Deploys nothing.
- memoryPrompts: 24 unique prompts for a full profile (was 15), enough for an hour at one per 3 min without repeating. Added: evenings in the hometown, radio in their teenage decade, the 1957 satellite (age-gated like other era events), and six gentle general prompts (night sky where they grew up, a pet, outdoor games, Saturdays, kitchen smells, who taught them to cook). Same function signature. 109 tests pass.
## 2026-09-26 02:50 UTC — Codex — offline integration and demo pass
- Integrated reviewed PWA patch 4c3ae9b and engine/data/docs through 245bbd6 into claude-ui. All 132 tests pass (including 15 worker fault-injection tests and 10 UI/helper tests); production build passes. Manifest URLs now work under a sub-path.
- Browser: live Dallas lookup and nonsense-city no-match both pass. At 768x1024, Setup for 1942 shows 44 songs; Today, Moonrise mode, log, demo-week generation, learned schedule, and report pass. Demo routine moves from 45 to 60 minutes before dusk with an explicit demo badge.
- Browser midnight fixture (test/fixtures/midnight.html, dev-only): 00:45 rejected at 00:30; 23:30 saves September 26 with the prior dusk and song IDs. Fixed clock/weather are clearly labeled in the fixture and absent from the production build.
- Actual production server stopped: app reload and new navigation still render using the service worker; state survives. Updated build loads online; final offline-update check follows. No real mobile/iOS test yet.
- Accessibility/readability: 20px body text and >=48px controls checked, tablet + 390px layouts inspected without horizontal overflow. Added report row/column headers, stronger sky/prompt contrast, and reduced-motion behavior. Printed layout is styled; in-app browser does not expose print preview, so native print validation is pending.
- Songs now enter the evening log only when a music link is opened, not merely displayed. Report language describes association rather than causation; sky timing is labeled an estimate, and caregiver-support disclaimer appears on Today. No main merge/deployment by Codex.
## 2026-09-26 02:44 UTC — Claude — CI + more memory prompts
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: npm ci, npm test, npm run build on every push and PR (all branches). Deploys nothing.
- memoryPrompts: 24 unique prompts for a full profile (was 15), enough for an hour at one per 3 min without repeating. Added: evenings in the hometown, radio in their teenage decade, the 1957 satellite (age-gated like other era events), and six gentle general prompts (night sky where they grew up, a pet, outdoor games, Saturdays, kitchen smells, who taught them to cook). Same function signature. 109 tests pass.

## 2026-09-26 02:52 UTC — Claude — sky gradient contrast (L5 review, engine-side fix)
- skyGradient day/dusk stops darkened so white text is >= 4.5:1 (WCAG AA) on every color the gradient passes through, top and bottom (was as low as 1.43:1 on the daytime horizon). Day is still blue, dusk deep orange, night unchanged. Pinned by a new test that checks 101 points. 111 tests pass. No interface change.

## Codex — visual direction and constellation, September 25 night
- Ketan explicitly requested a substantially more polished UI and beneficial light gamification, and authorized Higgsfield artwork using existing credits. Implemented a midnight/ivory visual system, original lightweight lake/lunar art, live-phase SVG moon, larger clear hero action, expandable weather explanation, redesigned screens/nav and a visible moon stage separated from controls. Native fullscreen is now opt-in.
- A seven-evening constellation counts logged dates equally across calm/restless/episode and labels demo data. No streak pressure or patient outcome score. Added integration regression coverage. All 137 tests pass before final integration; production build succeeds. 20px body/56px routine controls measured in the browser; mobile moon remains visible.
- Integrated main56ccb58 and enginebc1ac52 locally; next integrate Kanishk's newer main55acd4e. Screen styles are separate from print. Claude independently confirmed the earlier print refinements yield one page at Letter/A4 on8764863; requesting recheck of this design.
- Two Higgsfield image jobs, no video, purchases or deployment. Asset jobs/prompts and visual story in DESIGN.md. HTML preloads put both art assets into the committed shell.
## 2026-09-26 02:52 UTC — Claude — sky gradient contrast (L5 review, engine-side fix)
- skyGradient day/dusk stops darkened so white text is >= 4.5:1 (WCAG AA) on every color the gradient passes through, top and bottom (was as low as 1.43:1 on the daytime horizon). Day is still blue, dusk deep orange, night unchanged. Pinned by a new test that checks 101 points. 111 tests pass. No interface change.
- Final integration at901e45a includes main55acd4e and manual deploy preparation, without running deployment. 137 tests pass; root and /moonrise/ builds pass. Added a uniform dark overlay after checking artwork pixel luminance; semantic panels remain opaque. Phone controls measured56px and20px type; SVG moon always visible in its own stage.
- Addressed Claude's24ac6f9 review: moon now rises through36% of its separate art stage over60minutes (about187px desktop,101px tablet,79px phone). Reduced-motion users get a fixed28% position. A dev-only clock-control fixture supports visual inspection without touching system time or production data.
## 2026-09-26 03:12 UTC — Claude — loadState hardening
- loadState now cleans stored data instead of passing it through: logs without a valid 'YYYY-MM-DD' date or known outcome are dropped; optional fields are repaired (bad episodeStart/effectiveDusk -> null, non-numeric cloudCover -> null, songIds filtered to strings, episodeStart cleared on non-episode evenings); one log per date (later wins), sorted; extra fields (demo) kept.
- A profile without an integer birthYear and finite lat/lon loads as null (back to Setup) instead of producing NaN times. Non-object JSON loads as empty state.
- Same signature. 143 tests pass (UI tests included).
- Added matching SVG/192px/512px home-screen icons, an Apple PNG touch icon, and aligned browser theme colors. Both raster icons are shell-referenced. Keyboard Tab -> sky disclosure -> Enter works; focus ring is explicit. Live iOS installation is still untested.

## 2026-09-26 03:20 UTC — Claude — loadState follow-up (Codex review)
- Dates must be real calendar dates (logs and tonight). Profile needs a non-blank text name or it loads as null (Setup); city/anchors always strings (valid values kept, missing ones become ''). tonight kept only with a real date, songIds always string[]. Demo flags and valid values untouched. 149 tests; 150 when test-merged with claude-ui d3d1845.

## 2026-09-26 03:24 UTC — Claude — README/DEMO wording (Codex submission review)
- README and DEMO.md no longer overstate: "estimated dusk" and "suggested start time" (prototype rules, not measurements or clinical predictions); songs are "linked with calmer evenings" via opened links (association, not proven benefit or confirmed playback); alerts only while the app is open.
- README now discloses how it was built (two AI coding agents), the Higgsfield artwork (see DESIGN.md), the outcome-neutral constellation, and that the app runs no AI model at runtime.
- DEMO.md steps updated for the redesign ("Your evening begins at", "Tonight's sky · estimated dusk", constellation).
- Open question for Kanishk: the hackathon page reportedly lists "a working AI-powered project"; the app has no runtime AI.
- Integrated Claude's733270a storage repair and80ab809 accurate demo/README wording. Added an app-level regression proving a malformed stored session can open a song and save a new evening;151 tests pass. A320px browser check exposed a clock/phase-label collision despite no horizontal overflow; responsive clock size and a reserved moon column fix it. Long user text now wraps safely.
- Final report wording is neutral even when every ranked song appears only on episode evenings: "Songs from your evenings" (the engine ranks all opened songs, not just positive scores). Empty state now says no song links recorded; missing weather gets a count. Today says "based on" logs and accurately describes the3-evening +1timed-episode threshold. README/DEMO labels updated together.
## 2026-09-26 03:29 UTC — Claude — runtime AI: caregiver-reviewed memory prompts (engine side)
- Kanishk asked to add runtime AI now (hackathon lists "a working AI-powered project"). Key stays on the device (pasted in Settings); cheapest option, no hosting.
- New `src/engine/ai.js`: `generateMemoryPrompts(profile, { apiKey, existing?, count? }) -> Promise<string[]>`, rejects with `AiPromptError` (`.code`: no_key | bad_key | rate_limited | offline | refused | bad_output | service). Official @anthropic-ai/sdk, loaded lazily (not in the startup bundle/offline shell), `claude-opus-5`, effort low, Zod structured output, server-side refusal fallback. Sends only birth year/era + non-blank anchors; never the name, location or logs. Output cleaned (length, dupes, upsetting topics) before caregiver review.
- `memoryPrompts(profile, { song, approved })`: approved prompts come right after the song prompt, deduped. `state.approvedPrompts` cleaned on load. Key: `loadAiKey/saveAiKey/clearAiKey` under its own localStorage key, never in app state.
- Verified: 163 tests; a live call with a fake key reaches the API and maps to bad_key (Node). In headless Chromium the SDK loads and sends the browser-access header, but the sandbox proxy's certificate isn't trusted by Chromium, so browser->API is unverified here.
- UI needed (Codex): Settings key field + Generate + review/approve list; pass approvedPrompts to memoryPrompts.

## 2026-09-26 03:32 UTC — Claude — AI prompts switched to Haiku 4.5
- Kanishk chose Claude Haiku 4.5 (`claude-haiku-4-5`) over Opus 5 for cost/speed (~0.3¢ vs ~1-2¢ per Generate). Now `client.messages.parse` with `zodOutputFormat`; no effort, thinking, fallbacks or betas (Haiku 4.5 rejects effort; tests pin their absence). Interface unchanged. 163 tests; live fake-key call still maps to bad_key.
## Codex — optional AI prompt review and demo accuracy, September 25 night
- Integrated engine 9c6ddf7. Settings now saves/removes a masked, separate API key; explains exactly what goes to Anthropic and API credit use; generates only on a caregiver click; holds drafts in memory for Approve/Skip; persists only approved prompts; and supports removal. Late replies after leaving Settings are ignored, duplicate requests are blocked, and built-in prompts remain available on failure.
- Moonrise mode includes only approved prompts and labels them AI-written/reviewed. Delete all data also removes the separate saved key, with an error if removal fails. No real API key was accessed or used by Codex.
- 173 tests pass, including eight new UI regressions for approval boundaries, key isolation/removal, storage errors, late requests, empty output, reload and routine use. Production build passes. Real browser at 390px: no overflow, text >=20px, controls >=56px; a dummy key reaches the live API and shows the correct authentication error, then was removed. Dev-only simulated-reply fixture verifies review layout and Approve/Skip behavior; it is excluded from production.
- DEMO distinguishes decorative artwork from astronomical inputs, records the verified primary 2026 report statistic (12.7M caregivers / 19.6B hours in 2025, printed p52), and includes an honest AI demonstration. README privacy copy names transferred fields and avoids claiming every filter guarantees suitability. A successful real-key generation remains for Kanishk; an invalid-key check does not prove successful model output.
## 2026-09-26 03:41 UTC — Claude — AI prompts: Codex review fixes
- max_tokens bounded to 2048 (`AI_MAX_TOKENS`).
- SDK chunk load failure (e.g. first use while offline) now rejects with `AiPromptError` code `offline`; error mapping no longer re-imports the SDK (uses the already-loaded classes / HTTP status), so nothing escapes the documented contract. Timeouts map to `offline`.
- Privacy wording corrected everywhere: we send birth year/era and the three anchor answers as typed; never the profile name, saved location or logs (an answer can itself contain a name or place).
- 164 tests; live fake-key call still maps to bad_key.

## Codex — visual redesign v2, September 25 night
- Ketan requested a stronger UI, a rocket launch and public clinical-data research. Rebuilt Today as a quiet observatory with desktop side navigation, moonlit scene, personal journal and neutral constellation. Redesigned Setup, Log and Report using shared ivory/apricot/sage styling. All source remains editable; existing local artwork reused without extra credits or dependencies.
- Explicit Start plays a silent 2.4s native rocket flight, with Skip/Escape/reduced-motion bypass and focus transfer. Routine adds Quiet view and manual Next prompt with polite announcements. Screen navigation returns to the top; after-midnight heading and empty-era messaging are accurate.
-182 tests/17 files pass, including5 launch tests plus integrated start/auto-completion/focus, Quietview/manual prompts, midnight heading and empty catalog. Root and /moonrise/ production builds pass. Browser inspected1280x720 desktop and320/390/768px widths; phone/tabled review panels used600px height for final interactions. No horizontal overflow in measured320/390 cases, measured controls >=48px. Verified Start/Skip/routine/Quiet/restore/Nextprompt/Finish and return-to-top. Existing report print layout isolated from new screen-only CSS; independent updated print/offline/reduced-motion rendering review requested from Claude. Do not substitute v1 checks for v2.
- Public TIHM Labels.csv suitability audit (outside repo):608records/49participants,135 agitation records/27participants. No training or predictive evaluation;6-hour labels cannot validate minute-level timing; terminal-illness treatment excluded. No Moonrise patient testing or hospice readiness claim. Dataset license notes need clarification for commercial use. Aggregate reproducible outputs remain in Ketan's handoff; raw data never entered app/repo.
- Reviewed Claude experimental5063b6e; current UI does not consume proposed calm probabilities, confidence ranges or promising-song milestones. Requested correction of unsupported inference and mixed-demo progress disclosure. Original engine ranking/timing retained here. Successful real-key AI generation still awaits Kanishk's private test. Codex did not deploy or merge main.
## Codex — direct music playback, September 26
- Imported only the additive music data/API/tests from Claude fb577f2: `songVideo(songId)` is now a shared export and playlist items include `hasVideo`. Existing song identities, scores and ordering are unchanged; unrelated learning/progress changes are not imported. All 15 YouTube candidates remain `verified: false`; metadata lookup is not playback verification.
- The routine uses an in-card player, with user-initiated visible YouTube playback only for verified IDs and a separately credited CC0 piano recording. Only observed YouTube PLAYING records an era song; the piano choice never does. Quiet view, song changes and Finish stop active audio. The bundled piano recording is eligible for exact-asset offline caching; remote music is never downloaded or cached.
- Added local audio selection with native controls, visible filename, no upload, object-URL revocation on replacement/quiet/exit, and no mapping to era-song outcomes. Files are selected again after leaving the routine; the user-supplied commercial recording was not bundled or copied into the repository.
- Service worker v3 commits the full bundled piano with the shell, validates audio MIME/status, and serves single bounded/open-ended/suffix byte ranges offline. Unknown/remote audio is never cached. Failed audio downloads, partial responses, HTML fallbacks and quota errors leave the previous committed shell usable. Binary cache tests cover byte accuracy, conditionals, malformed ranges and subpaths.
- 231 tests pass across19 files. Root and /moonrise/ builds independently emit the same provenance-checked3,499,346-byte MP3. In isolated production Chrome, the HTTP server was stopped before the first Play: piano played with duration176.61s and no media error, then sought to129.87s with the server still stopped. Reload reopened the app from its offline shell. Safari/iOS native playback remains untested. Separate provider QA returned ERROR150 for Sinatra, Mancini and Armstrong; no candidate promoted.
## 2026-09-26 04:06 UTC — Claude — learning evidence + milestones (METHODOLOGY.md)
- Kanishk asked for trained, not random, scores and light gamification. Built Bayesian alternatives, then tested them with a seeded simulation (`node scripts/simulate-learning.mjs`): the simple AGENTS.md rules won both studies, so ranking and start time are unchanged. Full write-up: METHODOLOGY.md.
- New (additive): `songStats(logs)` (Beta-Bernoulli evidence per song: plays/calm/restless/episode/score/calmRate/low/high/status untried|learning|promising|unpromising); `playlist()` and `weeklyReport().topSongs` items gain calmRate/status (ordering unchanged); `moonriseStart()` gains `range {earliest, latest}`, `halfWidthMinutes`, `confidence` (calibrated ~80% in simulation); `progress(logs)` milestones with `usesDemo`.
- Honesty rule for UI: "promising" songs were truly helpful only ~39% of the time in simulation. Show "worth trying again" + counts, never "helps".
- 194 tests.

## 2026-09-26 04:10 UTC — Claude — learning narrowed per Codex review
- Supersedes the previous entry. Public contract is now narrow and descriptive: `songEvidence(logs)` -> { [id]: { plays, calm, restless, episode, score } }; `evidenceText(e)` -> "Opened on 5 logged evenings: 3 calm, 1 restless, 1 episode."; `weeklyReport().topSongs` items gain calm/restless/episode/evidenceText; `progress(logs)` = 4 process-only milestones (first-evening, first-song, start-from-logs, week) with usesDemo.
- Removed: songStats/calmRate/status labels, moonriseStart range/confidence, outcome milestones. playlist() and moonriseStart() are exactly the AGENTS.md contract again.
- METHODOLOGY.md rewritten: evidence boundary (no trained model, no clinical validation; Codex's TIHM audit: 6-hour labels, license restrictions), rules, and the simulation of what was tried and rejected. 184 tests.

## 2026-09-26 04:15 UTC — Claude — engine fixes from Codex review
- Report per-song plays count distinct evenings (Set per evening), matching songEvidence; regression added.
- schedule.js is byte-identical to the original AGENTS.md version again (stale shrinkage/range header removed).
- METHODOLOGY: median robustness claim now qualified by sample size. 187 tests.

## 2026-09-26 04:38 UTC — Claude — in-app music data (approved by Codex in issue #1)
- `src/data/videos.json`: 15 YouTube candidates (1950s-70s, incl. Sinatra "Fly Me to the Moon" 1964) found by web search, official artist/label/"Provided to YouTube" uploads only; catalog ids unchanged; all `verified: false`. youtube.com is blocked from Claude's sandbox, so none were opened.
- `songVideo(songId)` -> { youtubeId, watchUrl, embedUrl (youtube-nocookie, no autoplay) } only when `verified: true` (set by hand after real in-app playback); else null. `playlist()` items gain `hasVideo`; ordering unchanged.
- `scripts/verify-videos.mjs [--write]` records oembedStatus/oembedCheckedAt/oembedInfo only; never sets `verified`; non-200 kept as-is.
- Ambient pad dropped per Codex (it's packaging a CC0 fallback). 193 tests.
## Codex — integrate reviewed main baseline, September 26
- Merged origin/main5e0b1dc into claude-ui only, preserving the new direct/local/offline music player and generic recorded-song-activity labels. Main remains unchanged by Codex. Resolved status history, additive contract exports and a YouTube-specific source comment. Scheduling and song ranking are unchanged; descriptive engine helpers remain unused by UI.
- Prior player headee73268 passed231tests, bothroot/basebuilds and GitHubCI. This integration is validated in GitHubCI to avoid restarting browsers/build servers on the host after Ketan reported computer crashes.

## Codex — inert offline piano reference, September 26
- Replaced the active audio prefetch hint with an inert HTML template. Vite still emits the exact hashed piano URL for service-worker shell discovery, while the browser has no active media element or prefetch to request before playback. Worker interception, audio allowlist and range handling are unchanged.
- 245 tests pass across 20 files with one worker at a time; the 42 worker tests now exercise inert-template discovery plus the existing offline audio boundaries. Root and /moonrise/ builds pass, and DOM checks confirm the inert reference matches the player bundle and emitted 3,499,346-byte recording in both. Normal dist remains the root build. No browser, server or media-render process was started for this fix; a fresh browser offline-network audit remains for Claude.
## 2026-09-26 05:16 UTC — Claude — wording matches final music behaviour
- evidenceText now reads "Played in the app on N logged evenings: …" (songs are recorded only on an observed in-app PLAYING event; piano/local files never). Milestone 'first-song' titled "First song played in the app". METHODOLOGY/README updated. Not yet shown by any screen. 244 tests.

## 2026-09-26 05:56 UTC — Claude — SUBMISSION.md + deploy blocker
- Added SUBMISSION.md: paste-ready Devpost text with required disclosures (no patient testing/clinical validation; rules not predictions; AI-built; generated fictional promo; TIHM boundary; CC0 piano).
- Pages deploy on 87e710e failed again (404): the repository is PRIVATE, and GitHub Pages on a free plan needs a public repo (or Pro). History scanned: no secrets (96 commits; only fake test keys), no media besides the CC0 piano. Making it public exposes commit author emails/hostnames.

## Codex — submission accuracy review, September 26

- Reviewed Claude's submission draft at main 794a0f6 against the implemented UI, engine and accepted 46.9-second ad. Corrected local-storage/privacy wording, remote weather and AI transfers, unverified real-key AI status, decorative moonrise and calculated sun position, dusk-relative scheduling thresholds/clamps, actual music availability and offline conditions.
- Removed unsupported claims about every-merge audits, visible per-song outcome counts, all YouTube uploads failing, universal model superiority and medical-device classification. Scoped commercial-recording statements to the app/repository and disclosed the separate user-supplied ad soundtrack; public soundtrack distribution rights are not documented in this project.
- Documentation-only; no runtime changes or new test runs. Full integrated-main audit remains 245 tests / 26 offline checks. Reviewed the final text and checked whitespace. No deployment or main merge by Codex.

## Codex — GitHub Pages MP3 MIME compatibility, September 26

- Live Pages serves the bundled piano as `audio/mp3`; the prior `audio/mpeg`-only check rejected the complete shell and prevented worker activation. Worker v4 accepts those two exact MIME types (including existing case/parameter handling), while retaining the exact asset allowlist, status 200, no Content-Range and nonempty-body requirements.
- Added a regression that first reproduced `shell incomplete after download`, then passed installation, activation, offline navigation and byte-range delivery under `/moonrise/` with the production MIME alias. Both MP3 types retain partial/HTML/empty-response rollback coverage; malformed MIME lookalikes and unrelated binary MIME are rejected.
- All 53 worker tests and 256 tests across 20 files pass with one worker at a time; root and `/moonrise/` production builds pass. These are VM delivery tests, not a new browser decoding check. Local commit only: live redeployment and browser offline verification remain with Claude/root.

## Codex — deterministic first-play test fixture, September 26

- The integrated playback test reused an evening with Earth Angel already recorded. Its randomized playlist occasionally selected that same song, correctly suppressing a duplicate callback and failing the test's new-play expectation. This test now starts with an empty played-song list; shared midnight fixtures and all runtime behavior are unchanged.
- Checked fresh main `c7eb364` before editing. All 12 flow tests and the full 256-test suite pass with one worker at a time. Local test-only commit; no push, main merge or deployment.

## 2026-09-26 — Codex: included listening library and offline playback

- Added ten approved, source-verified MP3 recordings alongside the existing Für Elise recording: 11 real playable selections. The source/rights agent verified full decoding; final copied file sizes and SHA-256 hashes match the approved catalog. Includes Let Me Call You Sweetheart (1911) and Shine On, Harvest Moon (1909), with required performance/restoration credits preserved. No other staged recordings or source evidence were copied.
- The music card opens on an accessible native library picker/player. Nothing autoplays; changing recordings, Quiet view, and Finish stop the old audio. Personal file playback remains private and separate; only verified YouTube candidates appear behind an optional control. Credits and first-download/offline details live under About this recording.
- Actual native playing events add immutable bundled recording IDs once per session/evening. Selection/loading/errors do not count. Existing era IDs and old logs are unchanged; historical piano/file plays are not inferred. Report passes both metadata catalogs into the existing engine so old and new records display together; unknown recording years are omitted. No engine/index/storage changes.
- Conversation prompts no longer name an unrelated era song while an included or local recording plays. Today/Setup now accurately describe the shared library and birth-year conversation context. Reminder wording identifies routine reminders, not a research risk predictor. AGENTS/README updated for the user-approved bundled audio workflow.
- Service worker v5 commits the full explicitly declared library atomically and handles native byte-range seeks from full cached MP3s. Failed downloads, HTML fallbacks, partial responses, or quota failures retain the previous complete shell. The new ten MP3s are about19.26MiB; the full11-track library is23,692,563bytes. Keep the app online until the first download finishes; browser storage eviction can remove offline data.
- Validation:280 tests pass using maxWorkers1, including all11 selections, actual-play logging/deduplication, mixed old/new stored history/report, every bundled track's offline range seeking, multiple-file update rollback, and catalog integrity. Root and /moonrise/ builds pass. Every built audio path/hash matches its UI import, inert HTML declaration, and SW allowlist in both builds. git diff --check passes.
- Next/root: inspect320px layout and native controls/credits, verify real playback and offline seeking in the browser, then review/push. Claude should update submission/demo copy to describe the included library; no era-matching claim for these recordings. Experimental research remains separate from app reminders.

## 2026-09-26 06:22 UTC — Claude — live offline fix integrated + redeploy
- Codex's hosted smoke test found the live offline blocker (GitHub Pages serves the MP3 as audio/mp3; worker only accepted audio/mpeg, so install failed). Integrated Codex's fix 9cfc60f (worker v4 accepts audio/mpeg or audio/mp3).
- scripts/verify-offline.cjs now serves MP3 as audio/mp3 like GitHub Pages (and serves by path so redeploys work). Old worker: fails at the first check; fixed worker: 26/26. 256 tests.
## 2026-09-26 06:40 UTC — Claude — flaky playback test fixed + deployed
- The c7eb364 Pages build failed once at flows.test.jsx:112; one re-run deployed c7eb364 (worker v4) to GitHub Pages.
- Integrated Codex's c89f944 root-cause fix (fixture already listed the randomly chosen song as played). Test-only; next deploy should not need a re-run.
## 2026-09-26 07:10 UTC — Claude — docs: TIHM research benchmark results
- METHODOLOGY.md, SUBMISSION.md, README.md now state Codex's separate TIHM benchmark factually (participant-separated folds, AP 0.047 vs clock-only 0.027, interval of difference includes zero, 3.7% precision at threshold, no high-precision setting found). No model connected to the app; no clinical claims. SUBMISSION links no longer say "make public first".

## Codex — library browser QA and integrated main review
- Integrated origin/main74219d5 into claude-ui only, keeping both status histories and the Pages-like offline verification helper. Corrected broad no-model wording to distinguish the separate TIHM predictor from optional pretrained AI conversation prompts; clarified the precision follow-up support constraints and all-abstain result. No runtime research model introduced.
- Chrome320px: library picker264×56px,documentwidth320; expanded recording credits remained within viewport. All11recordings reached native Playing here with DevToolsOffline1 after a complete-shell reload. Native seek controls worked for every track; Harvest Moon screenshot confirmed0:44/2:05 thenseek1:23/2:05 whileoffline. Quietviewremovedplayer. RestoredOffline0,closedDevTools,resetviewport andleft localplayerstopped. This is browser offline-emulation verification; no human listening or Safari/iOS playback claim.

## Codex — independent offline music downloads, September 26

- Worker v6 installs the app shell plus Für Elise atomically; the other ten recordings download independently after activation or on demand. Failed, slow, partial, HTML, redirected, empty or quota-rejected extra downloads cannot block the core install or discard completed recordings. Only exact declared audio URLs with validated complete audio responses enter the separate persistent audio cache.
- Preserved completed v5 library caches through the worker update, including when storage quota prevents copying them. Worker restarts retain completed extra recordings and retry missing tracks; core/build changes still commit only after the required shell and piano are complete. Native offline byte-range seeking remains supported.
- The music picker now reports per-recording Ready offline / Not downloaded / Offline status unknown from the worker's actual cache status. Older workers and unsupported status messages remain unknown. Download/retry controls never autoplay or interrupt active audio; missing offline recordings offer the available piano fallback and reconnect guidance. Reconnecting resumes independent downloads.
- Validation: 301 tests pass across 23 files using one worker, including 80 worker tests for partial libraries, first install with every extra missing, interrupted downloads, restart/update migration, rejected responses, per-track status and offline piano seeking. Root and /moonrise/ production builds pass. Both builds declare one core and ten extra tracks, and all 11 emitted file sizes/hashes, player imports and worker allowlists match the approved catalog. Whitespace checks pass.
- Root dist contains the final build. Root is conducting first-install browser verification with extra MP3s deliberately unavailable, followed by physically stopping the server and testing offline shell/piano playback and fallback. Browser results, push, merge and deployment remain with root/Claude; no research API changes are included here.

## Codex — physical server-stop music verification
- Fresh Chrome origin4178 deliberately returned404 for all ten extra recordings. Core installed and the picker correctly showed1/11 ready. Physically stopped that test server, reloaded the app successfully, and played Für Elise to6.88s with no mediaerror. Missing Gymnopédie playback offered the saved piano fallback.
- Restarted the test server with extra recordings enabled, used Download for offline use, and observed11/11 ready. Physically stopped the server again; Gymnopédie, Greensleeves and Harvest Moon all advanced with finite durations/no mediaerror. Quiet view removed/stopped the player. No network emulation was needed for this check; external weather connectivity remained available.
- Found and fixed native error→pause event ordering overwriting the useful failure message with Paused. Added a regression for preservederror/fallback/no falseplaylog;28focusedplayer/offlineUItests pass. Full301-test suite/build evidence above precedes this one-line UI correction; a later full integration run will include it.

## Codex — optional laptop-only OpenAI prompt gateway, September 26

- Added a separate Node loopback gateway and masked connection page at http://127.0.0.1:4180/connect. It serves the root production build and keeps the OpenAI key only in process memory (or accepts a launch environment key); no key is returned, logged, written to app files, or saved in browser storage. Saving a key reports configured only, not verified API access. Disconnect/process exit forgets it.
- The gateway accepts exact Host and same-Origin JSON requests with a custom header and Fetch Metadata checks, binds only to 127.0.0.1, provides no CORS/proxy/model/tool controls, and validates a strict birth-year/hometown/spouse/job allowlist. Name, city/coordinates, logs and prior prompts are excluded. Requests use the fixed documented gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14 Responses model with structured output, store:false, 700 output tokens, 30-second timeout, one concurrent generation and bounded attempt rates. Errors never echo upstream bodies; output is bounded, validated, cleaned and returned only as drafts.
- Settings detects the gateway only on http://127.0.0.1; the public hosted Anthropic path and built-in prompts remain intact. Local drafts use the existing explicit approval gate and only approved text is saved. No engine/data/research files changed, no predictive model was connected, and no public backend was added. Worker v7 bypasses the local connection page and local routes so setup never falls back to a cached app or enters caches. Browser-data deletion wording distinguishes it from the separately running server key.
- Validation: 338 tests passed across 26 files with one worker, including 27 gateway HTTP/security/mock cases, local profile/hosted-origin isolation, explicit approval, retained Anthropic flow, and worker exclusions. Native Node boot and HTTP200 setup response were checked. Root and /moonrise/ production builds passed; the subpath output stays outside this repository. Readiness_check's independent source review found no blocking security or flow issue. OpenAI model/schema/data-control details were checked against official documentation and linked in README.
- Live key generation/entry and browser validation are owned by root. At this entry, no successful live OpenAI request has been observed; Chrome reported a client-side block despite the local page returning HTTP200. Do not report a configured key or mocked success as verified live access. No push, main merge or deployment by this task.

## Codex — successful live OpenAI connection check
- After Ketan completed masked key entry in the Codex in-app browser, Settings at127.0.0.1:4180 confirmed the local OpenAI connection. A single real request from a fictional Demo/1942 profile (no personal anchors) returned six drafts. No key was read from the server, logged or committed. No browser protection was changed.
- Approved one draft and skipped another. Exactly one approved prompt was saved; Moonrise mode displayed it with the AI-written/reviewed label. Returning to Settings retained only that approved prompt; remaining drafts were not saved. Finished the verification session without logging a care outcome. The11-track cache reported11/11ready.
- This closes the local demo's positive API-path verification gap. The server remains running with its memory-only key; stopping it requires reconnecting. The public Pages app still uses Anthropic and has not been reconfigured, merged or deployed by Codex. No clinical model or hospice validation claim follows from this prompt-generation check.

## Codex — research results and independent workload diagnostic
- Added RESEARCH_RESULTS.md and updated methodology/submission/README to include the completed personal-baseline experiment: 50 participants, 8,918 windows, 128 recorded-label windows, 60 model fits; paired logistic AP improved from 0.0504 to 0.0640 with descriptive difference interval 0.0025–0.0278. All three candidate results are retained, and the failed fixed precision/support policy remains explicit.
- A separate agent examined saved inner/outer predictions without retraining. Fixed inner-score workload settings of 1%, 5% and 10% transferred unevenly. Personal-baseline nominal 5% produced 221 flags and 20 matches (9.05% recorded-label precision, 15.62% recall), at 2.48% actual held-out coverage. All six settings are reported, with no post-hoc winning policy selected. Unlabelled comparisons are not confirmed negatives.
- Local aggregate-only handoff includes the visual evidence summary, full results/protocols and reproducible diagnostic. No identifiers, individual predictions, raw records, fitted models or credentials enter this repository. No new training, app runtime changes, main merge or deployment in this documentation task; clinical/hospice readiness remains unsupported.

## Codex — continuous rocket flight and attached trail
- Replaced three independently eased percentage motion stages with a single continuous Bézier flight. Rocket heading follows the curve tangent; its engine nozzle and the growing trail share the same point and timing in one SVG coordinate system. A smooth start/finish removes the old stage-boundary velocity changes. Only SVG attributes update per frame; layout is measured at mount/resize.
- Preserved the 2.4-second completion, current callback, Skip/Escape, focus, reduced-motion bypass/change handling and cleanup. All 22 affected launch/flow tests pass, including responsive nozzle alignment, continuity at former stage joins and no per-frame layout reads. Root production build passed. Full unrelated local tests were not repeated during observed host startup slowness; CI will perform the complete suite.
- Root verified the actual rebuilt app at 127.0.0.1:4180 in the in-app browser. Forty sampled live frames across the normal window, 320px phone and 1280px desktop geometries had matching trail endpoints and rocket nozzle coordinates; visual captures agreed, and automatic routine entry worked. This is not a measured frame-rate benchmark. Temporary viewport overrides were reset, existing caregiver logs preserved, and no verification outcomes were logged. The memory-only API server stayed running.

## Codex — complete CI and bounded broader research results
- Rocket/runtime head 06b23253a8617bbe920abfa346ebfbbc18b937a3 passed full CI: 341 tests in 26 files and production build (247ms), run https://github.com/kanishksatish/moonrise/actions/runs/36227163156 . Later edits in this entry are documentation only.
- Ketan requested continued tuning. Completed one additional, pre-locked grid of ten candidates, 200 fits, one numerical thread, exact same 50-person cohort/features/folds, inner-only selection. Primary pooled AP 0.039279, interval 0.022111–0.064810; paired delta versus saved recent-logistic −0.011101 (−0.056303–0.030290). Mixed weighted-logistic/boosting score scales affect pooled comparison; all fold results and candidates remain disclosed. All 50 strict cutoff searches failed support; policy abstained, missed all 128 labels, precision undefined. No post-result fitting or requirements changes.
- Separate independent reviewer reproduced saved model predictions, nested selections, thresholds, 500 bootstrap summaries, all input/model/code/protocol hashes and 120 training-partition scalers with zero fits. Private files were unchanged. Added RESEARCH_BROADER.md and updated the research summary/disclosures. Public deliverables contain aggregate results/code only; no predictor is connected to care decisions and no hospice validation is claimed.

## Codex — overnight caregiver workflow and design integration (in review)
- Ketan made Codex the implementation owner while Claude is inactive and requested autonomous overnight improvement. Separate workers handled Today/setup, session/music, and caregiver records; root is integrating with independent review.
- Shared contract update: optional `log.careContext = {source: 'caregiver', comfortSteps: string[]}` uses known step IDs only. Missing/invalid means unrecorded; an explicitly saved empty array means none of the listed steps. The engine index exports functions `cleanCareContext`, `comfortStepsText`, `logsForHandoff`, and `handoffCoverage`, the string `CARE_PLAN_NOTE`, and the five-choice `{id, label}` array `COMFORT_STEPS`. Legacy records remain usable; outcome/onset edits retain existing real context; real observations cannot inherit fictional context or be overwritten by demo loading.
- Handoff calculations select recorded or fictional data first. The report includes missing evenings, optional-context/onset completeness, explicit example provenance and local-time information. Historical song IDs remain unchanged and are not upgraded into claims of verified listening.
- Coherent observatory design across Today, Setup, session and Settings; simpler patient-facing conversation labels with provider/data-sharing disclosure and explicit approval retained in caregiver settings. Actual worker-confirmed offline music availability is visible in Settings. Stop music can cancel pending playback and resets audio without inventing a play log; Quiet view unmounts audio.
- Independent review prompted pending-play Stop, legacy music wording and reset-failure fixes. Persistence failures remain visible during sessions; a failed reset retains the current profile/logs rather than appearing complete. Provider checks gate generation and ignore superseded responses.
- Validation and actual responsive/print-browser results are pending integration below. No deployment/main merge, unsupported predictor or clinical validation claim. The local key server remains running and existing user logs are preserved.

### Overnight integration validation
- Full local run covered 372 tests across 30 files: 370 passed, one stale Today-copy assertion failed and was updated, and one AI-flow test exceeded the default 5-second limit under host contention. The three affected integration files then passed all 30 tests with a 15-second per-test allowance. Gateway tests used isolated loopback servers and fictional keys; the initial sandbox EPERM was resolved with the permitted test run. No real API requests in this pass.
- Root visually inspected actual built Today, Settings, Log and session at 320px and 1280px, plus the source-separated report at 320px. No horizontal document overflow; optional comfort controls measured 58px high. Existing user data was not changed. Chrome fictional-profile setup/city lookup and example generation succeeded. Native Chrome print preview showed the seven-evening/five-song fictional handoff as one unclipped page. Nothing was printed.
- Browser automation stalled around print preview; native Chrome control subsequently recovered. On the isolated fictional profile, actual piano playback advanced, Stop returned a stopped player, Quiet removed the active player, returning to conversation did not autoplay, and explicit Play worked again. Saving a restless observation with Familiar music and Quiet company produced a recorded-only report with one observation, six missing evenings and the two exact steps, excluding fictional records from recorded counts. Native time-field keyboard editing saved Sep 25, 11:30 PM while retaining both steps, and the example view excluded that recorded evening. The direct browser fill helper did not trigger React’s native time change; keyboard editing did. Phone and tablet moon refinements are now visually checked on the current build; low-motion browser checks remain queued.
- Local preview recovery: prior gateway process was already absent (no4180 listener; old session unknown), so IAB had shown its saved offline build. Restored the same address without a key and confirmed the new screen; browser profile, one existing log and approved prompt were retained. The previous memory-only key must be reconnected by its owner. Built-in/approved prompts and cached music remain available. No secrets were read or recovered.

### Engine contract regression correction
- CI for `3eeec52` found the export allowlist had not been updated for the six care-context exports. Updated the contract test to separate functions from constants, retain exact-export checking, and check the text constants plus all five `{id, label}` choices. README and the shared-contract entry above now name the same exports and types. No runtime behavior changed.
- Focused engine contract, care-context, and report tests passed: 14 tests across 3 files. This correction changes tests/documentation only; the production build is unchanged. Fresh full CI is pending on the correction commit.

### Overnight browser polish checkpoint
- Exact correction commit `a85c608` passed all 373 tests and production build in CI run 36229154285.
- Extended the compact moon lighting treatment through the 850px tablet breakpoint after observing a clipped glow at 768px. CSS only; desktop and Quiet remain unchanged. Production build passed, refreshed built asset `index-Bj1fGsUR.js`, and actual 768px session showed the clean moon without the rectangular glow. 320px and 768px documents had no horizontal overflow.

### Persistence recovery and offline rehearsal
- Independent review found Log could ignore a failed device save and still show success or leave the editor. Log now honors a false update result, retains editable details and onset-removal retry, and shows a nearby unsaved message. Manually returning to Today also preserves unsaved wording. A global retry can save retained edits outside the Log editor; failed resets retain their dedicated deletion retry instead.
- Added regression cases for failed outcomes, time edit/removal, comfort-step retry, manual navigation and recovery. All six new Log cases passed locally; host contention caused an existing test timeout and later worker startup stalls. Local broad confirmation is not claimed; full CI is pending for this patch. Independent read-only review found no blocker; its reset-retry ambiguity was corrected.
- Updated built app reopened with offline emulation. Settings confirmed all eleven recordings cached; Gymnopédie played to 1:53/3:07 while DevTools showed Offline and a ServiceWorker 206 response with zero network transfer. Quiet stopped playback. With reduced-motion emulation enabled, the routine opened and remained usable; no numerical animation-count or FPS claim. Restored No throttling and No emulation afterward. No user-origin records or credentials touched.

## Codex overnight accessibility and reminder follow-up — September 26
- Keyboard fixes landed in 727043e/b775bdd: screen entry and optional onset focus, stable focus after prompt review/removal, and focused phone controls clear of the fixed navigation. Exact b775bdd CI passed385tests/30files and production build; actual Chrome keyboard paths and320px layout inspected with fictional data.
- Routine notification handling now stays mounted in App across caregiver screens. Successful deliveries are deduplicated by evening/stage for that open app session, permission grants are reconsidered, and failed delivery stays retryable. Starting a routine suppresses further reminders for that evening; a real same-evening observation suppresses them, while demo rows do not.
- Settings/Report/Log offer a visible View routine reminder while relevant, including when browser notifications are unavailable or denied. Notification permission remains user-triggered. Payloads contain only generic routine text; no profile data is sent in a notification. Research and schedule formulas are unchanged.
- Validation before push:35focused hook/App tests passed and production build passed. Independent source review found no blocker. Actual delivery/permission scenarios were verified with deterministic mocked browser APIs; no OS notification permission was requested during visual QA. The real local app remains on the isolated fictional rehearsal profile for UI inspection.
- Browser/device availability still controls timing, and reload begins a new dedupe session. This is a routine reminder, with no clinical prediction or patient-validation claim. No main merge or deployment by Codex. Next: exact-commit CI, retain the private gateway, then morning readiness handoff.
- Visual QA also corrected the old blue document background appearing below long pages and removed the browser outline around programmatic route containers; interactive controls retain their visible focus outlines.

### Profile and selected-starter save recovery
- A failed first setup or profile edit now stays in the form with its details retained, an adjacent unsaved warning and a usable Save retry. Existing pending changes remain visible while editing; leaving an unsaved submission is explicitly labeled. A successful retry persists the complete state and returns to Today.
- Selected-starter approval/removal now distinguishes current-session changes from successful device saves. Failed removal remains retryable even when the list becomes empty; pending selections no longer promise offline persistence. Example-data changes and the browser-data heading also reflect pending saves. Failed deletion retains its separate deletion recovery and does not offer an unrelated selection-save retry.
- Added seven integration regressions covering first setup, editing, retained records, approval-only use during failure, removal/reload recovery and example data. The affected three test files passed46tests locally; after the independent review caught the reset-button ambiguity, the corrected AI flow passed12tests. Production build passed1.41s. Refreshed the real isolated rehearsal app and visually inspected Settings and profile controls; normal Cancel returned correctly without modifying the fictional records. Storage failures were simulated only in tests. No real provider requests, credentials or user-origin records were touched. Exact-commit CI follows before handoff.

### Current submission and readiness documentation
- Exact runtime commit ec2fcce passed410tests/31files and production build in CI36233256716. Refreshed SUBMISSION.md to reflect the eleven-recording native library, current caregiver workflows, software checks, current local connection requirements and research limits. Removed obsolete piano-only/era-display/test-count claims and the unverified introductory statistic. No public deployment or patient validation is claimed.
- Prepared a current local demo/readiness handoff and separate submission copy. Independent factual review found no material readiness/research/source-conflation issue. Existing final V6 film and PowerPoint are linked, with actual PowerPoint playback and public soundtrack rights still unresolved.
- Clarified the research summary chronology: the60-fit personal-baseline experiment preceded the200-fit broader comparison. No results, thresholds, fitted models or research code changed. The aggregate evidence archive updates only that summary text.
- Read only the local gateway's status: server running, configured:false. No key was read, no request generated and no server restarted. The earlier successful six-draft/one-approved demonstration remains historical evidence; reconnect before new generation. This documentation-only task does not warrant repeating unchanged browser or runtime checks.

## 2026-09-26 — Codex — connected evening workflow and visual redesign
- Replaced the home hierarchy with a personal evening workspace: story/photo, caregiver cues, topics to avoid, prepared activities, immediate Start and optional moonflight. Reused existing licensed/generated artwork; added no paid media or dependencies.
- Shared session now follows explicit caregiver choices. Story, music and quiet are optional; decline is recorded without a score. Unsubmitted observations cannot silently disappear on Finish. Native and YouTube pause/end report actual player stops, distinct from caregiver actions.
- Added backward-compatible personal plan and session records. Each session snapshots its plan, preserves timestamped sources, and produces a factual on-device handoff with exact-record caregiver review. New/changed source content invalidates review. This is not an AI clinical note or a treatment recommendation.
- Added local photo resize/storage: JPEG/PNG/WebP input up to8MiB, resized960px JPEG without original metadata/name, IndexedDB limit20. Only unsubmitted draft photos are cleaned up; submitted and earlier-session photos are retained. Photos and new preparation/session content are excluded from generation requests. Reset locks controls while deletion is pending; failures preserve records.
- Demo session content, approved personal starters and real timing/journal data are separated. Existing records are retained; no unsupported predictor or new clinical claim.
- Validation: local full run495passed/3stale button-label expectations; corrected labels then all28tests in the two affected files passed. Total498tests/37files now covered. Production build passed. Independent source review findings resolved. Actual isolated4181 browser rehearsal: phone390x844 and desktop visual inspection, local-photo save/reload/session display, decline→quiet→observation→finish, source inspection and caregiver review, and fictional/recorded separation. Original4180 records and server untouched; no provider call. Expanded report print layout not rechecked.
- Browser upload tool stalled for about3h27m before returning; no work is claimed during the wait. Recovered and completed the explicit verification above. No deployment or main merge. Next: exact-commit GitHub checks and presentation-device rehearsal; patient pilot decisions remain external.


## 2026-09-26 — Codex — single launch and restored evening log
- User requested one Start Moonrise entry, original rocket animation, clear activity-button behavior, less filler copy, and Finish through the evening indicators. Start now always opens the existing2.4s rocket/moon sequence, which retains Skip/Escape/reduced-motion support. Removed the separate moonflight entry. Story/Music/Quiet selects the first activity and updates a concise preview sentence.
- Finish now opens How was tonight? with Calm/Restless/Episode, optional comfort/onset details, then Report. The saved outcome is also recorded in the session handoff. Skipping leaves the indicator unknown. Fictional-session indicators remain within the example session and never overwrite the real journal.
- Removed requested slogans and other nonfunctional copy from home/session/navigation/report. Kept source labels, provider disclosures, and actual caregiver controls.
- Prior-promise audit caught remaining recall-demanding built-in prompts; replaced them with optional topics while preserving saved approved wording, era eligibility and song independence. The proposed provider-generated handoff remains intentionally unimplemented; the current handoff is factual/local and is not called an AI clinical note.
- User explicitly directed research OUT of the app. No research tab/component is integrated. A separate presentation slide reports the existing public-data experiments, including the failed broader alert result; no new fits or patient-row display.
- Initial affected UI checks58/58passed, productionbuildpassed. Actual isolated4181 rehearsal confirmed activitypreview, visible rocket, selectedMusic screen, Finish->Log->Restless->Report with saved indicator/source. Phone390x844Startvisible. Original4180records/server untouched. Final prompt tests, rebuiltcopy and exact-commitCI follow.
- Final local validation:58affected UI checks +52prompt/care-workflow checks +8launch checks passed (overlapping files, not a combined suite count); productionbuildpassed3.02s. Review found and fixed stale-onset propagation after a failed removal: Leave for now now bypasses indicator creation; dedicated regression passed. Clicking the alreadyactiveLog tab no longer drops the fictional-session context. CPU-heavy work kept serial.
## 2026-09-26 23:45 UTC — Claude — submission integration: claude-ui + brief items restored
- Reviewed claude-ui 73f01f2 (504 tests, build, verify-offline 26/26, browser audit). Kanishk chose to ship it with brief items restored.
- Restored: Moonrise mode live sky (SkyStage: real-sky gradient, stars, warm glow, moon rising over 60 min), prompts auto-rotating every 3 min (promptAt), era song from their youth with YouTube/Spotify search links (not logged as plays); Today sky card with start countdown, estimated dusk, moon phase, and a labelled demo-week start shift (real suggestion still ignores demo logs); Setup shows songs from their youth.
- Report: AGENTS.md doctor line shown again; prints on one page (Letter and A4); empty session-handoff box hidden in print.
- Docs corrected (SUBMISSION test counts/wording, DEMO labels, README). 508 tests / 38 files.
## 2026-09-27 01:40 UTC — Claude — submission build: aligned to updated brief, end-to-end verified
- Per updated AGENTS.md (no search links, library not era-matched): removed era-song search links and Setup era list; the Moonrise stage now shows "Now playing" with the recording actually playing. Live sky, rising moon, glow, 3-minute prompt rotation, Today countdown/moon phase and labelled demo shift stay.
- Real-use fixes: evening note shows onset in local time (was raw UTC ISO); printed weekly report is page 1 and a recorded session handoff prints on page 2 (source toggles hidden); "Not recorded" no longer title-cased.
- Scripted browser run of a full evening passes (setup, sky card, real piano playback, prompts, observation, episode log, reload persistence, report, print, demo week, AI bad-key error message). Added TESTING.md and a "What data we used" section in SUBMISSION.md.
## 2026-09-27 02:40 UTC — Claude — Devpost submission package
- submission/DEVPOST.md: copy-paste text for every Devpost field (title, links, ELI5 explainer, problem/audience with sourced stats, page-by-page navigation, evening indicators tracked, how it learns + TIHM training explained plainly, tech stack, build story, credits, disclosures, submit checklist). Video links left as PASTE for Ketan.
- submission/screenshots/: 13 automated screenshots (setup, today, sky card, launch, Moonrise music/story, log, report recorded/example/printed, settings, phone). App code unchanged; no redeploy needed.
# Hosted judge-demo connection (Codex, September 26–27)

Ketan is setting up his own fork on Vercel to let remote judges generate drafts without entering a key. Added a separate hosted adapter; the laptop-only gateway and upstream live Pages app are unchanged. Shared-contract addition: export the existing cleanGeneratedPrompts helper for hosted responses. Provider data fields and the caregiver approval gate remain unchanged. This branch is preparation only: no deployment, provider-key access, live generation or clinical validation is claimed. Vercel firewall and OpenAI spending controls must be configured before enabling the public endpoint. See HOSTING.md for exact setup and verification.

Verification: all 540 tests in 41 files pass, including 32 new hosted server/client/review checks. Hosted production build passes. Initial unprivileged full run had 27 loopback-permission failures plus one stale engine-contract expectation; the expectation was updated and the permitted full run passed. Chrome's isolated hosted-review fixture verified Generate → Skip → Approve and the updated disclosure/layout with simulated replies, no provider call and no saved personal records. Real deployed function routing, provider billing/access and firewall behavior remain post-deployment checks.
